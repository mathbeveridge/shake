Act 1, Scene 1

xxx:
[of thunder and lightning heard]


xxx:
[Enter a Master and a Boatswain]


MasterShip:
Boatswain!


Boatswain:
Here, master_Master: what cheer?


MasterShip:
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.


xxx:
[Exit]


xxx:
[Enter Mariners]


Boatswain:
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master_Master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!
[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND,]
GONZALO, and others]


Alonso:
Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master_Master?
Play the men.


Boatswain:
I pray now, keep below.


Antonio-tem:
Where is the master_Master, boatswain?


Boatswain:
Do you not hear him_master? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.


Gonzalo:
Nay, good, be patient.


Boatswain:
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.


Gonzalo:
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.


Boatswain:
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.


xxx:
[Exit]


Gonzalo:
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.


xxx:
[Exeunt]


xxx:
[Re-enter Boatswain]


Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
[A cry within]
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
the weather or our office.
[Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO]
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?


Sebastian-tem:
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!


Boatswain:
Work you then.


Antonio-tem:
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.


Gonzalo:
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.


Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
sea again; lay her off.


xxx:
[Enter Mariners wet]


Mariners:
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!


Boatswain:
What, must our mouths be cold?


Gonzalo:
The king_Alonso and prince_Ferdinand at prayers! let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.


Sebastian-tem:
I'm out of patience.


Antonio-tem:
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!


Gonzalo:
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at widest to glut him.
[A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'--]
'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and
children!'--
'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!']


Antonio-tem:
Let's all sink with the king_Alonso.


Sebastian-tem:
Let's take leave of him_Alonso.


xxx:
[Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN]


Gonzalo:
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
die a dry death.

[Exeunt]


----------------------------------------

Act 1, Scene 2

xxx:
[Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA]


Miranda:
If by your art, my dearest father_Prospero, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.


Prospero:
Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your_Miranda piteous heart
There's no harm done.


Miranda:
O, woe the day!


Prospero:
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter_Miranda, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater father.


Miranda:
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.


Prospero:
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
[Lays down his mantle]
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.


Miranda:
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'


Prospero:
The hour's now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
Out three years old.


Miranda:
Certainly, sir, I can.


Prospero:
By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.


Miranda:
'Tis far off
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?


Prospero:
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
How thou camest here thou mayst.


Miranda:
But that I do not.


Prospero:
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.


Miranda:
Sir, are not you my father_Prospero?


Prospero:
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou_Miranda wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
And princess no worse issued.


Miranda:
O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?


Prospero:
Both, both, my girl_Miranda:
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither.


Miranda:
O, my heart bleeds
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd father_Prospero to,
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.


Prospero:
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state; as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?


Miranda:
Sir, most heedfully.


Prospero:
Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, who to advance and who
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.


Miranda:
O, good sir, I do.


Prospero:
I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which, but by being so retired,
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
And executing the outward face of royalty,
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Dost thou_Miranda hear?


Miranda:
Your tale, sir_Prospero, would cure deafness.


Prospero:
To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the king_Alonso
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
To most ignoble stooping.


Miranda:
O the heavens!


Prospero:
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
If this might be a brother_Antonio.


Miranda:
I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.


Prospero:
Now the condition.
The king_Alonso, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother_Antonio's suit;
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.


Miranda:
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to't.


Prospero:
Hear a little further
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Were most impertinent.


Miranda:
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?


Prospero:
Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
A mark so bloody on the business, but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but loving wrong.


Miranda:
Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!


Prospero:
O, a cherubim
thou_Miranda wast that did preserve me. thou_Miranda didst smile.
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.


Miranda:
How came party_Prospero ashore?


Prospero:
By Providence divine.
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, being then appointed
Master of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Which since have steaded much; so, of Gonzalo gentleness,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.


Miranda:
Would I might
But ever see that Gonzalo!


Prospero:
Now I arise:
[Resumes his mantle]
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
Here in this island we arrived; and here
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Than other princesses can that have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.


Miranda:
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir_Prospero,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?


Prospero:
Know thus far forth.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
And give it way: I know thou_Miranda canst not choose.
[MIRANDA sleeps]
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.


xxx:
[Enter ARIEL]


Ariel:
All hail, great master_Prospero! grave sir_Prospero, hail! I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to master_Prospero strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.


Prospero:
Hast thou_Ariel, spirit,
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?


Ariel:
To every article.
I boarded the king_Alonso ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.


Prospero:
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would not infect his reason?


Ariel:
Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
And all the devils are here.'


Prospero:
Why that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?


Ariel:
Close by, my master_Prospero.


Prospero:
But are they, Ariel, safe?


Ariel:
Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
The king's son_Ferdinand have I landed by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.


Prospero:
Of the king_Alonso ship
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
And all the rest o' the fleet.


Ariel:
Safely in harbour
Is the king_Alonso ship; in the deep nook, where once
master_Prospero call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the king_Alonso ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.


Prospero:
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
What is the time o' the day?


Ariel:
Past the mid season.


Prospero:
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously.


Ariel:
Is there more toil? Since master_Prospero dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what master_Prospero hast promised,
Which is not yet perform'd me.


Prospero:
How now? moody?
What is't Ariel canst demand?


Ariel:
My liberty.


Prospero:
Before the time be out? no more!


Ariel:
I prithee,
Remember I have done master_Prospero worthy service;
Told master_Prospero no lies, made master_Prospero no mistakings, served
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
To bate me a full year.


Prospero:
Dost Ariel forget
From what a torment I did free Ariel?


Ariel:
No.


Prospero:
Ariel dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in the veins o' the earth
When it is baked with frost.


Ariel:
I do not, sir_Prospero.


Prospero:
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou_Ariel forgot
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?


Ariel:
No, sir_Prospero.


Prospero:
thou_Ariel hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.


Ariel:
sir_Prospero, in Argier.


Prospero:
O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
They would not take Sycorax life. Is not this true?


Ariel:
Ay, sir_Prospero.


Prospero:
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A human shape.


Ariel:
Yes, Caliban Sycorax son.


Prospero:
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine and let thee out.


Ariel:
I thank thee, master_Prospero.


Prospero:
If thou_Ariel more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.


Ariel:
Pardon, master_Prospero;
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently.


Prospero:
Do so, and after two days
I will discharge Ariel.


Ariel:
That's my noble master_Prospero!
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?


Prospero:
Go make Ariel like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
[Exit ARIEL]
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou_Miranda hast slept well; Awake!


Miranda:
The strangeness of father_Prospero story put
Heaviness in me.


Prospero:
Shake it off. Come on;
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.


Miranda:
'Tis a villain, sir_Prospero,
I do not love to look on.


Prospero:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot miss Caliban: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.


Caliban:
[Within] There's wood enough within.


Prospero:
Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
Come, thou tortoise! when?
[Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph]
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.


Ariel:
My lord_Prospero it shall be done.


xxx:
[Exit]


Prospero:
Thou poisonous Caliban, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!


xxx:
[Enter CALIBAN]


Caliban:
As wicked dew as e'er my mother_Sycorax brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!


Prospero:
For this, be sure, to-night Caliban shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
All exercise on thee; Caliban shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.


Caliban:
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which Prospero takest from me. When Prospero camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the island.


Prospero:
Thou most lying Caliban,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
Filth as Caliban art, with human care, and lodged thee
In mine own cell, till Caliban didst seek to violate
The honour of my child.


Caliban:
O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.


Prospero:
Abhorred Caliban,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied Caliban,
Took pains to make Caliban speak, taught Caliban each hour
One thing or other: when Caliban didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though Caliban didst learn, had that in't which
good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast Caliban
Deservedly confined into this rock,
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.


Caliban:
Prospero taught me language; and my profit on't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me Prospero language!


Prospero:
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
If Caliban neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.


Caliban:
No, pray Prospero.
[Aside]
I must obey: his art is of such power,
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
and make a vassal of him.


Prospero:
So, slave; hence!
[Exit CALIBAN]
[Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing;]
FERDINAND following]
ARIEL'S song.
Come unto these yellow sands,
And then take hands:
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist,
Foot it featly here and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
Hark, hark!
[Burthen [dispersedly, within] Bow-wow]
The watch-dogs bark!
[Burthen Bow-wow]
Hark, hark! I hear
The strain of strutting chanticleer
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.


Ferdinand-tem:
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
No, it begins again.
[ARIEL sings]
Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
[Burthen Ding-dong]
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.


Ferdinand-tem:
The ditty does remember my drown'd father_Alonso.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.


Prospero:
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what Ferdinand seest yond.


Miranda:
What is't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir_Prospero,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.


Prospero:
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou_Miranda seest
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
And strays about to find 'em.


Miranda:
I might call him
A thing divine, for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.


Prospero:
[Aside] It goes on, I see,
As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
Within two days for this.


Ferdinand-tem:
Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?


Miranda:
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.


Ferdinand-tem:
My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.


Prospero:
How? the best?
What wert thou_Ferdinand, if the king_Alonso of Naples heard thee?


Ferdinand-tem:
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. king_Alonso does hear me;
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The king_Alonso my father wreck'd.


Miranda:
Alack, for mercy!


Ferdinand-tem:
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the duke_Antonio of Milan
And his brave son being twain.


Prospero:
[Aside]. The duke_Antonio of Milan
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
I'll set thee free for this.
[To FERDINAND]
A word, good sir;
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.


Miranda:
Why speaks my father_Prospero so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!


Ferdinand-tem:
O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make Miranda
The queen of Naples.


Prospero:
Soft, sir! one word more.
[Aside]
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light.
[To FERDINAND]
One word more; I charge thee
That thou_Ferdinand attend me: thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
From me, the lord on't.


Ferdinand-tem:
No, as I am a man.


Miranda:
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.


Prospero:
Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.


Ferdinand-tem:
No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.


xxx:
[Draws, and is charmed from moving]


Miranda:
O dear father_Prospero,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle and not fearful.


Prospero:
What? I say,
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.


Miranda:
Beseech you, father_Prospero.


Prospero:
Hence! hang not on my garments.


Miranda:
sir_Prospero, have pity;
I'll be his surety.


Prospero:
Silence! one word more
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
An advocate for an imposter! hush!
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels.


Miranda:
My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.


Prospero:
Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them.


Ferdinand-tem:
So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father_Alonso's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.


Prospero:
[Aside] It works.
[To FERDINAND]
Come on.
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
[To FERDINAND]
Follow me.
[To ARIEL]
Hark what thou else shalt do me.


Miranda:
Be of comfort;
My father_Prospero of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Which now came from him.


Prospero:
Thou shalt be free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command.


Ariel:
To the syllable.


Prospero:
Come, follow. Speak not for him.

[Exeunt]

Act 2, Scene 1

xxx:
[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,]
ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others]


Gonzalo:
Beseech you, sir_Alonso, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.


Alonso:
Prithee, peace.


Sebastian-tem:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.


Antonio-tem:
The visitor will not give him o'er so.


Sebastian-tem:
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
by and by it will strike.


Gonzalo:
Sir,--


Sebastian-tem:
One: tell.


Gonzalo:
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to the entertainer--


Sebastian-tem:
A dollar.


Gonzalo:
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
have spoken truer than you purposed.


Sebastian-tem:
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.


Gonzalo:
Therefore, my sir_Alonso,--


Antonio-tem:
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!


Alonso:
I prithee, spare.


Gonzalo:
Well, I have done: but yet,--


Sebastian-tem:
He will be talking.


Antonio-tem:
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to crow?


Sebastian-tem:
The old cock.


Antonio-tem:
The cockerel.


Sebastian-tem:
Done. The wager?


Antonio-tem:
A laughter.


Sebastian-tem:
A match!


Adrian-tem:
Though this island seem to be desert,--


Sebastian-tem:
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.


Adrian-tem:
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--


Sebastian-tem:
Yet,--


Adrian-tem:
Yet,--


Antonio-tem:
He could not miss't.


Adrian-tem:
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.


Antonio-tem:
Temperance was a delicate wench.


Sebastian-tem:
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.


Adrian-tem:
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.


Sebastian-tem:
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.


Antonio-tem:
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.


Gonzalo:
Here is everything advantageous to life.


Antonio-tem:
True; save means to live.


Sebastian-tem:
Of that there's none, or little.


Gonzalo:
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!


Antonio-tem:
The ground indeed is tawny.


Sebastian-tem:
With an eye of green in't.


Antonio-tem:
He misses not much.


Sebastian-tem:
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.


Gonzalo:
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
beyond credit,--


Sebastian-tem:
As many vouched rarities are.


Gonzalo:
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
salt water.


Antonio-tem:
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
say he lies?


Sebastian-tem:
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report


Gonzalo:
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
the king_Alonso fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.


Sebastian-tem:
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.


Adrian-tem:
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen.


Gonzalo:
Not since widow Dido's time.


Antonio-tem:
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow Dido!


Sebastian-tem:
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
how you take it!


Adrian-tem:
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.


Gonzalo:
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.


Adrian-tem:
Carthage?


Gonzalo:
I assure you, Carthage.


Sebastian-tem:
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
raised the wall and houses too.


Antonio-tem:
What impossible matter will he make easy next?


Sebastian-tem:
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple.


Antonio-tem:
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
forth more islands.


Gonzalo:
Ay.


Antonio-tem:
Why, in good time.


Gonzalo:
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter, who is now queen.


Antonio-tem:
And the rarest that e'er came there.


Sebastian-tem:
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.


Antonio-tem:
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.


Gonzalo:
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.


Antonio-tem:
That sort was well fished for.


Gonzalo:
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?


Alonso:
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?


Francisco-tem:
sir_Alonso, he may live:
I saw him beat the surges under him,
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.


Alonso:
No, no, he's gone.


Sebastian-tem:
sir_Alonso, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.


Alonso:
Prithee, peace.


Sebastian-tem:
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all of us, and the fair soul herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
son_Ferdinand,
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault's your own.


Alonso:
So is the dear'st o' the loss.


Gonzalo:
My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.


Sebastian-tem:
Very well.


Antonio-tem:
And most chirurgeonly.


Gonzalo:
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.


Sebastian-tem:
Foul weather?


Antonio-tem:
Very foul.


Gonzalo:
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--


Antonio-tem:
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.


Sebastian-tem:
Or docks, or mallows.


Gonzalo:
And were the king on't, what would I do?


Sebastian-tem:
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.


Gonzalo:
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--


Sebastian-tem:
Yet he would be king on't.


Antonio-tem:
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.


Gonzalo:
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.


Sebastian-tem:
No marrying 'mong his subjects?


Antonio-tem:
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.


Gonzalo:
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.


Sebastian-tem:
God save his majesty!


Antonio-tem:
Long live Gonzalo!


Gonzalo:
And,--do you mark me, sir?


Alonso:
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.


Gonzalo:
I do well believe your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing.


Antonio-tem:
'Twas you we laughed at.


Gonzalo:
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you: so you may continue and laugh at
nothing still.


Antonio-tem:
What a blow was there given!


Sebastian-tem:
An it had not fallen flat-long.


Gonzalo:
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing.


xxx:
[Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music]


Sebastian-tem:
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.


Antonio-tem:
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.


Gonzalo:
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me asleep, for I am very heavy?


Antonio-tem:
Go sleep, and hear us.


xxx:
[All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]


Alonso:
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.


Sebastian-tem:
Please you, sir_Alonso,
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.


Antonio-tem:
We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.


Alonso:
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.


xxx:
[ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL]


Sebastian-tem:
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!


Antonio-tem:
It is the quality o' the climate.


Sebastian-tem:
Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself disposed to sleep.


Antonio-tem:
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.


Sebastian-tem:
What, art Antonio waking?


Antonio-tem:
Do Sebastian not hear me speak?


Sebastian-tem:
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep. What is it Antonio didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
And yet so fast asleep.


Antonio-tem:
Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.


Sebastian-tem:
Thou dost snore distinctly;
There's meaning in thy snores.


Antonio-tem:
I am more serious than my custom: Sebastian
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
Trebles thee o'er.


Sebastian-tem:
Well, I am standing water.


Antonio-tem:
I'll teach Sebastian how to flow.


Sebastian-tem:
Do so: to ebb
Hereditary sloth instructs me.


Antonio-tem:
O,
If you but knew how Sebastian the purpose cherish
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth.


Sebastian-tem:
Prithee, say on:
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
Which throes thee much to yield.


Antonio-tem:
Thus, Sebastian:
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
And he that sleeps here swims.


Sebastian-tem:
I have no hope
That he's undrown'd.


Antonio-tem:
O, out of that 'no hope'
What great hope have you! no hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
That Ferdinand is drown'd?


Sebastian-tem:
He's gone.


Antonio-tem:
Then, tell me,
Who's the next heir of Naples?


Sebastian-tem:
Claribel.


Antonio-tem:
She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
And by that destiny to perform an act
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
In yours and my discharge.


Sebastian-tem:
What stuff is this! how say you?
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
There is some space.


Antonio-tem:
A space whose every cubit
Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
For your advancement! Do you understand me?


Sebastian-tem:
Methinks I do.


Antonio-tem:
And how does your content
Tender your own good fortune?


Sebastian-tem:
I remember
You did supplant your brother Prospero.


Antonio-tem:
True:
And look how well my garments sit upon me;
Much feater than before: my Prospero servants
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.


Sebastian-tem:
But, for your conscience?


Antonio-tem:
Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
No better than the earth he lies upon,
If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
They'll tell the clock to any business that
We say befits the hour.


Sebastian-tem:
Thy case, dear friend,
Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
And I the king shall love thee.


Antonio-tem:
Draw together;
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
To fall it on Gonzalo.


Sebastian-tem:
O, but one word.


xxx:
[They talk apart]


xxx:
[Re-enter ARIEL, invisible]


Ariel:
My master_Prospero through his art foresees the danger
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
For else his project dies--to keep them living.
[Sings in GONZALO's ear]
While you here do snoring lie,
Open-eyed conspiracy
His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care,
Shake off slumber, and beware:
Awake, awake!


Antonio-tem:
Then let us both be sudden.


Gonzalo:
Now, good angels
Preserve the king_Alonso.


xxx:
[They wake]


Alonso:
Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
Wherefore this ghastly looking?


Gonzalo:
What's the matter?


Sebastian-tem:
Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
It struck mine ear most terribly.


Alonso:
I heard nothing.


Antonio-tem:
O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions.


Alonso:
Heard you this, Gonzalo?


Gonzalo:
Upon mine honour, sir_Alonso, I heard a humming,
And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.


Alonso:
Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
For my poor son_Ferdinand.


Gonzalo:
Heavens keep Ferdinand from these beasts!
For he is, sure, i' the island.


Alonso:
Lead away.


Ariel:
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.


xxx:
[Exeunt]


----------------------------------------

Act 2, Scene 2

xxx:
[Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of]
thunder heard]


Caliban:
All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
For every trifle are they set upon me;
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.
[Enter TRINCULO]
Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
Perchance he will not mind me.


Trinculo:
Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off
any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
should thunder as it did before, I know not
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
of silver: there would this monster make a
man; any strange beast there makes a man:
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
thunderbolt.
[Thunder]
Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to
creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
dregs of the storm be past.


xxx:
[Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand]


Stephano-tem:
I shall no more to sea, to sea,
Here shall I die ashore--
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
funeral: well, here's my comfort. [Drinks]
[Sings]
The master_Master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
The gunner and his mate
Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
But none of us cared for Kate;
For she had a tongue with a tang,
Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:
Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.


xxx:
[Drinks]


Caliban:
Do not torment me: Oh!


Stephano-tem:
What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as
ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
and it shall be said so again while Stephano
breathes at's nostrils.


Caliban:
The spirit torments me; Oh!


Stephano-tem:
This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
should he learn our language? I will give him some
relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.


Caliban:
Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.


Stephano-tem:
He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
hath him, and that soundly.


Caliban:
Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.


Stephano-tem:
Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
which will give language to you, cat: open your
mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:
open your chaps again.


Trinculo:
I should know that voice: it should be--but he is
drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!


Stephano-tem:
Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
His forward voice now is to speak well of his
friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
will pour some in thy other mouth.


Trinculo:
Stephano!


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is
a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no
long spoon.


Trinculo:
Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and
speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy
good friend Trinculo.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee
by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's_Trinculo legs,
these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
he vent Trinculos_Trinculo?


Trinculo:
I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O
Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.


Caliban:
[Aside] These be fine things, an if they be
not sprites.
That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
I will kneel to him.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
cast ashore.


Caliban:
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
for the liquor is not earthly.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Here; swear then how thou escapedst.


Trinculo:
Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a
duck, I'll be sworn.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
duck, thou art made like a goose.


Trinculo:
O Stephano. hast any more of this?


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the
sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf_Caliban!
how does thine ague?


Caliban:
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'
the moon when time was.


Caliban:
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
My mistress_Sycorax show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
it anon with new contents swear.


Trinculo:
By this good light, this is a very shallow monster_Caliban!
I afeard of him! A very weak monster_Caliban! The man_Caliban i'
the moon! A most poor credulous monster_Caliban! Well
drawn, monster_Caliban, in good sooth!


Caliban:
I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.


Trinculo:
By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
monster_Caliban! when 's god's_Stephano asleep, he'll rob his bottle.


Caliban:
I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Come on then; down, and swear.


Trinculo:
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
monster_Caliban. A most scurvy monster_Caliban! I could find in my
heart to beat him,--


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Come, kiss.


Trinculo:
But that the poor monster's_Caliban in drink: an abominable monster_Caliban!


Caliban:
I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant_Prospero that I serve!
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
Thou wondrous man_Stephano.


Trinculo:
A most ridiculous monster_Caliban, to make a wonder of a
Poor drunkard_Stephano!


Caliban:
I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
I prithee now, lead the way without any more
talking. Trinculo, the king_Alonso and all our company
else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;
bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by
and by again.


Caliban:
[Sings drunkenly]
Farewell master_Prospero; farewell, farewell!


Trinculo:
A howling monster_Caliban: a drunken monster_Caliban!


Caliban:
No more dams I'll make for fish
Nor fetch in firing
At requiring;
Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish
'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban_Caliban
Has a new master_Stephano: get a new man.
Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
hey-day, freedom!


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
O brave monster_Caliban! Lead the way.

Act 3, Scene 1

xxx:
[Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log]


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress_Miranda which I serve quickens what's dead
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's_Prospero crabbed,
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress_Miranda
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
Most busy lest, when I do it.


xxx:
[Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen]


Miranda:
Alas, now, pray you,
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father_Prospero
Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
He's safe for these three hours.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
O most dear mistress_Miranda,
The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do.


Miranda:
If you'll sit down,
I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
I'll carry it to the pile.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
No, precious creature_Miranda;
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonour undergo,
While I sit lazy by.


Miranda:
It would become me
As well as it does you: and I should do it
With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
And yours it is against.


Prospero:
Poor worm_Miranda, thou art infected!
This visitation shows it.


Miranda:
You look wearily.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
No, noble mistress_Miranda;'tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
What is your name?


Miranda:
Miranda.--O my father_Prospero,
I have broke your hest to say so!


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
Admired Miranda!
Indeed the top of admiration! worth
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
Have I liked several women; never any
With so fun soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature's best!


Miranda:
I do not know
One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father_Prospero: how features are abroad,
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you,
Nor can imagination form a shape,
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly and my father's_Prospero precepts
I therein do forget.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
I am in my condition
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
I would, not so!--and would no more endure
This wooden slavery than to suffer
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service; there resides,
To make me slave to it; and for your sake
Am I this patient log--man.


Miranda:
Do you love me?


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief! I
Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
Do love, prize, honour you.


Miranda:
I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of.


Prospero:
Fair encounter
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
On that which breeds between 'em!


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
Wherefore weep you?


Miranda:
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
What I desire to give, and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife, it you will marry me;
If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
Whether you will or no.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
My mistress, dearest_Miranda;
And I thus humble ever.


Miranda:
My husband, then?


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
Ay, with a heart as willing
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.


Miranda:
And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell
Till half an hour hence.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
A thousand thousand!


xxx:
[Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally]


Prospero:
So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
For yet ere supper-time must I perform
Much business appertaining.

[Exit]


----------------------------------------

Act 3, Scene 2

xxx:
[Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink
water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and
board 'em. Servant-monster_Caliban, drink to me.


Trinculo:
Servant-monster_Caliban! the folly_Caliban of this island! They
say there's but five upon this isle: we are three
of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the
state totters.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Drink, servant-monster_Caliban, when I bid thee: thy eyes
are almost set in thy head.


Trinculo:
Where should they be set else? he were a brave
monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
My man-monster_Caliban hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I
could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
monster_Caliban, or my standard.


Trinculo:
Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
We'll not run, Monsieur monster_Caliban.


Trinculo:
Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
nothing neither.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Moon-calf_Caliban, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
good moon-calf.


Caliban:
How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.


Trinculo:
Thou liest, most ignorant monster_Caliban: I am in case to
justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
being but half a fish and half a monster?


Caliban:
Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord_Stephano?


Trinculo:
'Lord' quoth he! That a monster_Caliban should be such a natural!


Caliban:
Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's_Caliban
my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.


Caliban:
I thank my noble lord_Stephano. Wilt thou be pleased to
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Marry, will I. kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
and so shall Trinculo.


xxx:
[Enter ARIEL, invisible]


Caliban:
As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant_Prospero, a
sorcerer_Prospero, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.


Ariel:
Thou liest.


Caliban:
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey_Ariel, thou: I would my
valiant master_Stephano would destroy thee! I do not lie.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by
this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.


Trinculo:
Why, I said nothing.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.


Caliban:
I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
From me he got it. if thy greatness_Stephano will
Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
But this thing dare not,--


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
That's most certain.


Caliban:
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to the party_Prospero?


Caliban:
Yea, yea, my lord_Stephano: I'll yield him thee asleep,
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.


Ariel:
Thou liest; thou canst not.


Caliban:
What a pied ninny's_Ariel this! Thou scurvy patch_Ariel!
I do beseech thy greatness_Stephano, give him blows
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Trinculo, run into no further danger:
interrupt the monster_Caliban one word further, and,
by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors
and make a stock-fish of thee.


Trinculo:
Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
off.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Didst thou not say he lied?


Ariel:
Thou liest.


Stephano-tem:
Do I so? take thou that.
[Beats TRINCULO]
As you like this, give me the lie another time.


Trinculo:
I did not give the lie. Out o' your
wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
your monster_Caliban, and the devil take your fingers!


Caliban:
Ha, ha, ha!


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
off.


Caliban:
Beat him enough: after a little time
I'll beat him too.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Stand farther. Come, proceed.


Caliban:
Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
Having first seized his books, or with a log
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
First to possess his books; for without them
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
One spirit to command: they all do hate him
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter_Miranda; he himself
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
But only Sycorax my dam and she;
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
As great'st does least.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Is it so brave a lass?


Caliban:
Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
And bring thee forth brave brood.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
monster_Caliban, I will kill this man: his daughter_Miranda and I
will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
like the plot, Trinculo?


Trinculo:
Excellent.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.


Caliban:
Within this half hour will he be asleep:
Wilt thou destroy him then?


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Ay, on mine honour.


Ariel:
This will I tell my master_Prospero.


Caliban:
Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
You taught me but while-ere?


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
At thy request, monster_Caliban, I will do reason, any
reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
[Sings]
Flout 'em and scout 'em
And scout 'em and flout 'em
Thought is free.


Caliban:
That's not the tune.


xxx:
[Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe]


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
What is this same?


Trinculo:
This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
of Nobody.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.


Trinculo:
O, forgive me my sins!


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!


Caliban:
Art thou afeard?


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
No, monster_Caliban, not I.


Caliban:
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open and show riches
Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
I cried to dream again.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
have my music for nothing.


Caliban:
When Prospero is destroyed.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
That shall be by and by: I remember the story.


Trinculo:
The sound is going away; let's follow it, and
after do our work.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Lead, monster_Caliban; we'll follow. I would I could see
this tabourer_Ariel; he lays it on.


Trinculo:
Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.


xxx:
[Exeunt]


----------------------------------------

Act 3, Scene 3

xxx:
[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,]
ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others]


Gonzalo:
By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir_Alonso;
My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
I needs must rest me.


Alonso:
Old lord_Gonzalo, I cannot blame thee,
Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.


Antonio-tem_Antonio:
[Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so
out of hope.
Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
That you resolved to effect.


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
[Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage
Will we take throughly.


Antonio-tem_Antonio:
[Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night;
For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
As when they are fresh.


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
[Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more.


xxx:
[Solemn and strange music]


Alonso:
What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!


Gonzalo:
Marvellous sweet music!
[Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several]
strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;
they dance about it with gentle actions of
salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to
eat, they depart]


Alonso:
Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
A living drollery. Now I will believe
That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
At this hour reigning there.


Antonio-tem_Antonio:
I'll believe both;
And what does else want credit, come to me,
And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
lie,
Though fools at home condemn 'em.


Gonzalo:
If in Naples
I should report this now, would they believe me?
If I should say, I saw such islanders--
For, certes, these are people of the island--
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
Our human generation you shall find
Many, nay, almost any.


Prospero:
[Aside] Honest lord_Gonzalo,
Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
Are worse than devils.


Alonso:
I cannot too much muse
Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
Of excellent dumb discourse.


Prospero:
[Aside]. Praise in departing.


Francisco-tem_Francisco:
They vanish'd strangely.


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
No matter, since
They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
Will't please you taste of what is here?


Alonso:
Not I.


Gonzalo:
Faith, sir_Alonso, you need not fear. When we were boys,
Who would believe that there were mountaineers
Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
Good warrant of.


Alonso:
I will stand to and feed,
Although my last: no matter, since I feel
The best is past. Brother_Sebastian, my lord the duke_Antonio,
Stand to and do as we.
[Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a]
harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and,
with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes]


Ariel:
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
That hath to instrument this lower world
And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
Their proper selves.
[ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &c. draw their swords]
You fools! I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
And will not be uplifted. But remember--
For that's my business to you--that you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
Him and his innocent child_Miranda: for which foul deed
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
Against your peace. Thee of thy son_Ferdinand, Alonso,
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
Lingering perdition, worse than any death
Can be at once, shall step by step attend
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
And a clear life ensuing.
[He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music]
enter the Shapes again, and dance, with
mocks and mows, and carrying out the table]


Prospero:
Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
And observation strange, my meaner ministers
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
And these mine enemies are all knit up
In their distractions; they now are in my power;
And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
And his and mine loved darling.


xxx:
[Exit above]


Gonzalo:
I' the name of something holy, sir_Alonso, why stand you
In this strange stare?


Alonso:
O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
Therefore my son_Ferdinand i' the ooze is bedded, and
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
And with him there lie mudded.


xxx:
[Exit]


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
But one fiend at a time,
I'll fight their legions o'er.


Antonio-tem_Antonio:
I'll be thy second.


xxx:
[Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]


Gonzalo:
All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
Like poison given to work a great time after,
Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
May now provoke them to.


Adrian-tem_Adrian:
Follow, I pray you.


xxx:
[Exeunt]


****************************************


Act 4, Scene 1

xxx:
[Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA]


Prospero:
If I have too austerely punish'd you,
Your compensation makes amends, for I
Have given you here a third of mine own life_Miranda,
Or that for which I live; who once again
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
Were but my trials of thy love and thou
Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
And make it halt behind her.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
I do believe it
Against an oracle.


Prospero:
Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
Worthily purchased take my daughter_Miranda: but
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be minister'd,
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
As I hope
For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.
Our worser genius can, shall never melt
Mine honour into lust, to take away
The edge of that day's celebration
When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
Or Night kept chain'd below.


Prospero:
Fairly spoke.
Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!


xxx:
[Enter ARIEL]


Ariel:
What would my potent master_Prospero here I am.


Prospero:
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Did worthily perform; and I must use you
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
Incite them to quick motion; for I must
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
And they expect it from me.


Ariel:
Presently?


Prospero:
Ay, with a twink.


Ariel:
Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
Each one, tripping on his toe,
Will be here with mop and mow.
Do you love me, master_Prospero? no?


Prospero:
Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
Till thou dost hear me call.


Ariel:
Well, I conceive.


xxx:
[Exit]


Prospero:
Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
Or else, good night your vow!


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
I warrant you sir_Prospero;
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Abates the ardour of my liver.


Prospero:
Well.
Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!
No tongue! all eyes! be silent.


xxx:
[Soft music]


xxx:
[Enter IRIS]


Iris:
Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.


xxx:
[Enter CERES]


Ceres:
Hail, many-colour'd messenger_Iris, that ne'er
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?


Iris:
A contract of true love to celebrate;
And some donation freely to estate
On the blest lovers.


Ceres:
Tell me, heavenly bow,
If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
I have forsworn.


Iris:
Of her society
Be not afraid: I met her deity
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;
Mars's hot minion is returned again;
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
And be a boy right out.


Ceres:
High'st queen of state,
Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.


xxx:
[Enter JUNO]


Juno:
How does my bounteous sister_Ceres? Go with me
To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be
And honour'd in their issue.


xxx:
[They sing:]


Juno:
Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
Long continuance, and increasing,
Hourly joys be still upon you!
Juno sings her blessings upon you.


Ceres:
Earth's increase, foison plenty,
Barns and garners never empty,
Vines and clustering bunches growing,
Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
Spring come to you at the farthest
In the very end of harvest!
Scarcity and want shall shun you;
Ceres' blessing so is on you.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
This is a most majestic vision, and
Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold
To think these spirits?


Prospero:
Spirits, which by mine art
I have from their confines call'd to enact
My present fancies.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
Let me live here ever;
So rare a wonder'd father_Prospero and a wife_Miranda
Makes this place Paradise.
[Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on]
employment]


Prospero:
Sweet_Ferdinand, now, silence!
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
Or else our spell is marr'd.


Iris:
You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
Answer your summons; Juno does command:
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
A contract of true love; be not too late.
[Enter certain Nymphs]
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
In country footing.
[Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they]
join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;
towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts
suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a
strange, hollow, and confused noise, they
heavily vanish]


Prospero:
[Aside] I had forgot that foul conspiracy
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
Against my life: the minute of their plot
Is almost come.
[To the Spirits]
Well done! avoid; no more!


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
This is strange: your father's_Prospero in some passion
That works him strongly.


Miranda:
Never till this day
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.


Prospero:
You do look, my son_Ferdinand, in a moved sort,
As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir_Ferdinand.
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits and
Are melted into air, into thin air:
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep. sir_Ferdinand, I am vex'd;
Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
If you be pleased, retire into my cell
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
To still my beating mind.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
[with Miranda] We wish your peace.

[Exeunt]


Prospero:
Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.


xxx:
[Enter ARIEL]


Ariel:
Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?


Prospero:
Spirit_Ariel,
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.


Ariel:
Ay, my commander_Prospero: when I presented Ceres,
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
Lest I might anger thee.


Prospero:
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?


Ariel:
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
So fun of valour that they smote the air
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
their ears,
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
O'erstunk their feet.


Prospero:
This was well done, my bird_Ariel.
Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
For stale to catch these thieves.


Ariel:
I go, I go.


xxx:
[Exit]


Prospero:
A devil_Caliban, a born devil, on whose nature
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
And as with age his body uglier grows,
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
Even to roaring.
[Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &c]
Come, hang them on this line.
[PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter]
CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet]


Caliban:
Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole_Prospero may not
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
monster_Caliban, your fairy_Ariel, which you say is
a harmless fairy, has done little better than
played the Jack with us.


Trinculo:
monster_Caliban, I do smell all horse-piss; at
which my nose is in great indignation.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
So is mine. Do you hear, monster_Caliban? If I should take
a displeasure against you, look you,--


Trinculo:
Thou wert but a lost monster_Caliban.


Caliban:
Good my lord_Stephano, give me thy favour still.
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
All's hush'd as midnight yet.


Trinculo:
Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
monster_Caliban, but an infinite loss.


Trinculo:
That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
harmless fairy_Ariel, monster_Caliban.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
for my labour.


Caliban:
Prithee, my king_Stephano, be quiet. Seest thou here,
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
For aye thy foot-licker.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.


Trinculo:
O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
what a wardrobe here is for thee!


Caliban:
Let it alone, thou fool_Trinculo; it is but trash.


Trinculo:
O, ho, monster_Caliban! we know what belongs to a frippery.
O king Stephano!


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have
that gown.


Trinculo:
Thy grace shall have it.


Caliban:
The dropsy drown this fool_Trinculo I what do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
And do the murder first: if he awake,
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
Make us strange stuff.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Be you quiet, monster_Caliban. Mistress line,
is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
hair and prove a bald jerkin.


Trinculo:
Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
pass of pate; there's another garment for't.


Trinculo:
monster_Caliban, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and
away with the rest.


Caliban:
I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
With foreheads villanous low.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
monster_Caliban, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you
out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.


Trinculo:
And this.


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Ay, and this.
[A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,]
in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about,
PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on]


Prospero:
Hey, Mountain, hey!


Ariel:
Silver I there it goes, Silver!


Prospero:
Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
[CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are]
driven out]
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
Than pard or cat o' mountain.


Ariel:
Hark, they roar!


Prospero:
Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
Follow, and do me service.

[Exeunt]


****************************************


Act 5, Scene 1

xxx:
[Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL]


Prospero:
Now does my project gather to a head:
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?


Ariel:
On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord_Prospero,
You said our work should cease.


Prospero:
I did say so,
When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit_Ariel,
How fares the king_Alonso and's followers?


Ariel:
Confined together
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir_Prospero,
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
They cannot budge till your release. The king_Alonso,
His brother_Sebastian and yours_Antonio, abide all three distracted
And the remainder mourning over them,
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'
His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
That if you now beheld them, your affections
Would become tender.


Prospero:
Dost thou think so, spirit_Ariel?


Ariel:
Mine would, sir_Prospero, were I human.


Prospero:
And mine shall.
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
Do I take part: the rarer action is
In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
And they shall be themselves.


Ariel:
I'll fetch them, sir_Prospero.


xxx:
[Exit]


Prospero:
Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
The pine and cedar: graves at my command
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
By my so potent art. But this rough magic
I here abjure, and, when I have required
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
To work mine end upon their senses that
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
And deeper than did ever plummet sound
I'll drown my book.
[Solemn music]
[Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a]
frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;
SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,
attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all
enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,
and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO
observing, speaks:]
A solemn air and the best comforter
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
For you are spell-stopp'd.
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
And as the morning steals upon the night,
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
My true preserver, and a loyal sir
To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter_Miranda:
Thy brother_Sebastian was a furtherer in the act.
Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
I will discase me, and myself present
As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
Thou shalt ere long be free.
[ARIEL sings and helps to attire him]
Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
In a cowslip's bell I lie;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat's back I do fly
After summer merrily.
Merrily, merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.


Prospero:
Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Under the hatches; the master_Master and the boatswain
Being awake, enforce them to this place,
And presently, I prithee.


Ariel:
I drink the air before me, and return
Or ere your pulse twice beat.


xxx:
[Exit]


Gonzalo:
All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
Out of this fearful country!


Prospero:
Behold, sir king_Alonso,
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
For more assurance that a living prince
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
And to thee and thy company I bid
A hearty welcome.


Alonso:
Whether thou best he or no,
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
An if this be at all, a most strange story.
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
Be living and be here?


Prospero:
First, noble friend_Alonso,
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
Be measured or confined.


Gonzalo:
Whether this be
Or be not, I'll not swear.


Prospero:
You do yet taste
Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
[Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]
But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
And justify you traitors: at this time
I will tell no tales.


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
[Aside] The devil speaks in him.


Prospero:
No.
For you, most wicked sir_Sebastian, whom to call brother
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
Thou must restore.


Alonso:
If thou be'st Prospero,
Give us particulars of thy preservation;
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
My dear son Ferdinand.


Prospero:
I am woe for't, sir.


Alonso:
Irreparable is the loss, and patience
Says it is past her cure.


Prospero:
I rather think
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
And rest myself content.


Alonso:
You the like loss!


Prospero:
As great to me as late; and, supportable
To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
Than you may call to comfort you, for I
Have lost my daughter_Miranda.


Alonso:
A daughter?
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son_Ferdinand lies. When did you lose your daughter_Miranda?


Prospero:
In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
At this encounter do so much admire
That they devour their reason and scarce think
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
Been justled from your senses, know for certain
That I am Prospero and that very duke
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
Not a relation for a breakfast nor
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir_Alonso;
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
My dukedom since you have given me again,
I will requite you with as good a thing;
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
As much as me my dukedom.
[Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA]
playing at chess]


Miranda:
Sweet lord_Ferdinand, you play me false.


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
No, my dear'st love_Miranda,
I would not for the world.


Miranda:
Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
And I would call it, fair play.


Alonso:
If this prove
A vision of the Island, one dear son_Ferdinand
Shall I twice lose.


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
A most high miracle!


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
I have cursed them without cause.


xxx:
[Kneels]


Alonso:
Now all the blessings
Of a glad father_Alonso compass thee about!
Arise, and say how thou camest here.


Miranda:
O, wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
That has such people in't!


Prospero:
'Tis new to thee.


Alonso:
What is this maid_Miranda with whom thou wast at play?
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
And brought us thus together?


Ferdinand-tem_Ferdinand:
Sir, she is mortal;
But by immortal Providence she's mine:
I chose her when I could not ask my father_Alonso
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
Is daughter_Miranda to this famous Duke_Prospero of Milan,
Of whom so often I have heard renown,
But never saw before; of whom I have
Received a second life; and second father_Prospero
This lady_Miranda makes him to me.


Alonso:
I am hers:
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
Must ask my child_Miranda forgiveness!


Prospero:
There, sir_Alonso, stop:
Let us not burthen our remembrance with
A heaviness that's gone.


Gonzalo:
I have inly wept,
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
Which brought us hither.


Alonso:
I say, Amen, Gonzalo!


Gonzalo:
Was Milan_Prospero thrust from Milan, that his issue_Miranda
Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
Beyond a common joy, and set it down
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife_Miranda
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own.


Alonso:
[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands:
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
That doth not wish you joy!


Gonzalo:
Be it so! Amen!
[Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain]
amazedly following]
O, look, sir_Alonso, look, sir! here is more of us:
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
This fellow_Boatswain could not drown. Now, blasphemy_Boatswain,
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?


Boatswain:
The best news is, that we have safely found
Our king_Alonso and company; the next, our ship--
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
We first put out to sea.


Ariel:
[Aside to PROSPERO] sir_Prospero, all this service
Have I done since I went.


Prospero:
[Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit_Ariel!


Alonso:
These are not natural events; they strengthen
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?


Boatswain:
If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
Where but even now with strange and several noises
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master_Master
Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
Even in a dream, were we divided from them
And were brought moping hither.


Ariel:
[Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done?


Prospero:
[Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence_Ariel. Thou shalt be free.


Alonso:
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge.


Prospero:
sir_Alonso, my liege,
Do not infest your mind with beating on
The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
Which to you shall seem probable, of every
These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
And think of each thing well.
[Aside to ARIEL]
Come hither, spirit_Ariel:
Set Caliban and his companions free;
Untie the spell.
[Exit ARIEL]
How fares my gracious sir_Alonso?
There are yet missing of your company
Some few odd lads that you remember not.
[Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO]
and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel]


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
Every man shift for all the rest, and
let no man take care for himself; for all is
but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster_Caliban, coragio!


Trinculo:
If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
here's a goodly sight.


Caliban:
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
How fine my master_Prospero is! I am afraid
He will chastise me.


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
Ha, ha!
What things are these, my lord Antonio?
Will money buy 'em?


Antonio-tem_Antonio:
Very like; one of them
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.


Prospero:
Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave_Caliban,
His mother_Sycorax was a witch, and one so strong
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
And deal in her command without her power.
These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil_Caliban--
For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
To take my life. Two of these fellows you
Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
Acknowledge mine.


Caliban:
I shall be pinch'd to death.


Alonso:
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
He is drunk now: where had he wine?


Alonso:
And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
How camest thou in this pickle?


Trinculo:
I have been in such a pickle since I
saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
Why, how now, Stephano!


Stephano-tem:
O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.


Prospero:
You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah_Stephano?


Stephano-tem_Stephano:
I should have been a sore one then.


Alonso:
This is a strange thing_Caliban as e'er I look'd on.


xxx:
[Pointing to Caliban]


Prospero:
He is as disproportion'd in his manners
As in his shape. Go, sirrah_Caliban, to my cell;
Take with you your companions; as you look
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.


Caliban:
Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
Was I, to take this drunkard_Stephano for a god
And worship this dull fool!


Prospero:
Go to; away!


Alonso:
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.


Sebastian-tem_Sebastian:
Or stole it, rather.


xxx:
[Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]


Prospero:
sir_Alonso, I invite your highness and your train
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
Go quick away; the story of my life
And the particular accidents gone by
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
And thence retire me to my Milan, where
Every third thought shall be my grave.


Alonso:
I long
To hear the story of your life, which must
Take the ear strangely.


Prospero:
I'll deliver all;
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
Your royal fleet far off.
[Aside to ARIEL]
My Ariel, chick,
That is thy charge: then to the elements
Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.
[Exeunt]
EPILOGUE


xxx:
[Spoken by PROSPERO]


Prospero:
Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
And what strength I have's mine own,
Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
I must be here confined by you,
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
Since I have my dukedom got
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
In this bare island by your spell;
But release me from my bands
With the help of your good hands:
Gentle breath of yours my sails
Must fill, or else my project fails,
Which was to please. Now I want
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
And my ending is despair,
Unless I be relieved by prayer,
Which pierces so that it assaults
Mercy itself and frees all faults.
As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
Let your indulgence set me free.
